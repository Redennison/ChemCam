# ChemCam

## Project Overview
ChemCam, developed from November 2021 to January 2022, is a unique web-based application that converts chemical nomenclature into its corresponding chemical formula. It utilizes Python, Flask, pytesseract, OpenCV, and modern web technologies like HTML/CSS and Bootstrap. This platform supports both text and image inputs, making it versatile and user-friendly for chemistry enthusiasts and professionals.

### Key Features
- **Chemical Nomenclature Conversion**: Converts chemical names to formulas through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Image Recognition**: Integrates Tesseract OCR and OpenCV for character recognition, allowing users to upload images from which chemical names are extracted and converted.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Features a clean and easy-to-navigate interface with helpful documentation and a history of conversions.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **OCR**: pytesseract, OpenCV
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
